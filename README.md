# RENCTC: Timecode Workaround for Video Files

This script offers a workaround for adding timecode metadata to video files for improved compatibility with some software, particularly BlackMagic Design DaVinci Resolve. It's important to note that this is not a substitute for proper timecode generated by your camera. For precise syncing and timecode requirements, using cameras with built-in timecode or external timecode generators is highly recommended.

**Limitations:**

- Works only with non-drop frame rates.
- For drop frame rates (30000/1001 and 60000/1001), you'll need to modify the separator in line 41 from `:` to `;` as explained in the ffmpeg documentation: http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#toc-Advanced-options

**Requirements:**

- ffmpeg and ffprobe (installed in the same directory as the script)

**Script Usage (Windows Batch):**

1. Save the script as `renctc.bat` (or any preferred name with `.bat` extension).
2. Place the script and the video file(s) in the same directory.
3. Double-click the script to run it.

**Explanation:**

The script utilizes ffprobe to extract the original video encoding details and then leverages ffmpeg to re-encapsulate the video, incorporating timecode metadata based on the extracted information.

**Additional Notes:**

- Consider including a disclaimer that modifying video files can have unintended consequences, so users should back up their files before running the script.
- If you have further questions or require assistance with drop frame rates, feel free to consult the ffmpeg documentation or seek help from the ffmpeg community.
